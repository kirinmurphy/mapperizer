## Location Grabber GPT

https://chatgpt.com/g/g-kJ2i1rFDl-location-grabber  
Worked for a bit on this custom GPT to source location data. The GPT accepts a broad set of possible location descriptors, determines specific entities from these descriptors, scrapes the web for location data for each entity and returns structured result data.

The structured response includes a table of location metadata (address, web, phone, lat/long) plus a code snippet that can be copy pasted into the google spreadsheet.

So far surprisingly accurate results.

## To Run:

```
go mod tidy
go run ./src
```
